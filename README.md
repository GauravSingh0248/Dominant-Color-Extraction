# Dominant-Color-Extraction
Dominant Color Extraction

This Python project utilizes the K-Means clustering algorithm to extract and visualize the dominant colors from an image. It's implemented in a Jupyter Notebook for interactive exploration and analysis.

🧰 Requirements

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib scikit-learn scipy


📁 Project Structure

The repository contains:

Project - Dominant Color Extractions.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook implementing the color extraction and visualization.

img.jpg: Sample image used for color extraction.

README.md: This documentation file.

🖼️ How It Works

Image Loading: The image is loaded using OpenCV.

Reshaping: The image is reshaped into a 2D array of pixels.

K-Means Clustering: The K-Means algorithm is applied to cluster the pixels into k clusters, identifying the dominant colors.

Visualization: The dominant colors are displayed
Medium

⚙️ Usage

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/GauravSingh0248/Dominant-Color-Extraction.git
cd Dominant-Color-Extraction


Place your image in the repository directory and update the image path in the notebook.

Open and run the Project - Dominant Color Extractions.ipynb notebook.

📷 Sample Output

Upon execution, the notebook will display:
Reveal the Dominant Colors in Your Images Using Python and K-Means Clustering
or
Show the Extracted dominant colors.
